4. **ExecuteTrades()**: This function executes trades based on the calculated grid levels and predefined strategies. It opens positions at the specified price levels and manages the grid trading strategy.

5. **ManagePositions()**: This function manages open positions, including setting stop loss and take profit levels. It ensures proper risk management and protects the account from excessive losses.

6. **UpdateAccountEquity()**: This function provides real-time updates on the account equity and overall performance. It calculates the current balance, equity, and profit/loss and displays them in real-time.
